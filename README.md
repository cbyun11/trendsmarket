# Streamlit Dashboard for Inventory Management

This project was done as a part of the Carlson School MSBA program's Summer 2023 Trends Marketplace project.
My team showcased an easy-to-build dashboard tool using Streamlit, a Python-based dashboard-builidng tool.
I built this dashboard after my team members preprocessed the dataset and brainstormed dashboard elements.
